# task1_Elite_Intern
📊 Task 1 – ETL Pipeline Project
This project is part of my Elte Tech internship and demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python.

🔍 Overview
Built a data pipeline to:

Extract raw data from .csv

Transform by handling missing values using SimpleImputer

Created two outputs:

🧠 cleaned_data.csv (ML-ready)

👁️‍🗨️ human_readable_data.csv (for human use)

Load the cleaned data to CSVs for further analysis

🛠️ Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

💡 Outcome
Learned to prepare clean datasets for both machine learning and manual review as part of real-world ETL workflow.
